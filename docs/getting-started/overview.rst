Overview
========

Most of web applications provide a way for users to register, log in or reset their forgotten passwords. Rather than
re-implementing this on each application, you can use Yii2-user which is a flexible user management module for Yii2 that
handles common tasks such as registration, authentication and password retrieval. Current version includes following features:


* Registration, with an optional confirmation per mail
* Social auth
* Password retrieval
* Account and profile management
* Console commands
* User management interface

.. note::
    Module is in initial development. Anything may change at any time.

Codeception_ is used for testing and `Travis CI`_ is used for continuous integration.

Yii2-user is an open-source project and released under the `MIT License`_. You are very welcome to contribute to the module.

Yii2-user is a part of **Dektrium Project** which has been started with aim to provide useful extensions to your Yii2 application
under one vendor namespace. We hope that by providing extensions to common requirements, we will help developers concentrate on
the interesting things that their applications do.
